      <description>When my team at work started doing a lot of projects in GitHub, I had trouble keeping up with all the notifications from the issue tracker in Gmail. Which mails were about bugs assigned to me? Bugs that had me in @ mentions? Bugs just from projects I was watching? Couldn’t the labels on the issues also be labels on the issue emails?
I’ve always been a huge fan of Google Apps Script for productivity.</description>

      <description>This year, Logan loves his old costume and it still fit, but Cole is big enough to walk around! So I updated his Mike Wazowski costume, again with a green fleece bodysuit based on the trusty old Running With Scissors pattern, and taking Mike’s face off our baby carrier and putting it on an over-the-shoulder sack fleece cutout, which we stuffed with a pillow.
