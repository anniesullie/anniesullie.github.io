      <description>This is our first Halloween with two kids and I was excited to work on costumes for both of them. Logan loved watching Monsters Inc so I decided to do Sully and Mike Wazowski costumes.
I started work on Logan’s Sully costume first. After much Googling, I decided to buy a vintage McCall’s 6628 pattern online, and I bought turquoise fur fabric at fabric.com. After those arrived, there was a lot of cutting and sewing to do!</description>

      <title>Making a Board Book From Photos</title>

      <description>I’ve made a couple of books through Pint Size Productions and really liked them. When my two-year-old nephew came to visit, I wanted to take the photos from the visit and make them into a board book so he and my two-year-old son could remember them better.
And then I had an idea–wouldn’t it be cool to use Photoshop filters to make the book look hand-drawn? So I tried out a bunch of drawing and sketch plugins and settled on Akvis Sketch.</description>

      <title>Melted Crayon Easter Eggs</title>

      <description>We did Easter eggs for the first time this year. Logan requested that they be “scary”. So Doug and I shredded some crayons and we sprinkled them on the eggs while they were still hot after boiling. We all had a great time, and they look pretty different! Definitely cover the table and floor before trying this, though.

      <description>I got the book Cake Pops a while ago and I’ve been dying to try it out! There are a lot of recipes for spring, so I made some to take to the neighborhood Easter egg hunt. They were really easy to make and they taste great! I’m definitely going to try this again.

      <title>Sewing Star Wars Baby Blankets</title>

      <description>The Ann Arbor Sewing Center had some awesome Star Wars fabric, so I picked some up. I had some extra minky fabric from Logan’s Halloween Costume, and I thought it would be fun to make some baby blankets. They were super easy to make, just put the right sides of the fabric together, cut to the size you want, and sew, leaving an opening to pull the blanket right side out again.</description>
