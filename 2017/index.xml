      <description>Warning
Metal etching can be dangerous! If you&amp;rsquo;re going to try this, make sure to read all red the warning text at the bottom of the Edinburgh Etch page first!  The big reason I spent all the effort learning to use press n peel paper to etch (instead of cutting vinyl stencils on my cameo) is that I really wanted to be able to get the fine detail needed to etch a photograph onto metal.</description>

      <description>Warning
Metal etching can be dangerous! If you&amp;rsquo;re going to try this, make sure to read all red the warning text at the bottom of the Edinburgh Etch page first!  When I took the laser cutter class at Maker Works and learned about all the different materials you can etch, I was really interested in learning how to etch metal. But most lasers at makerspaces and such are CO2 lasers, which can’t etch metal.</description>

      <title>Baking Gingerbread Houses!</title>

      <description>As kids we always made milk carton gingerbread houses, but I’ve always wanted to try making a real one. I found this set of gingerbread house cookie cutters with a recipe book at Cost Plus World Market and decided to give it a shot with the kids and their cousin. It took some planning because we needed to bake the dough ahead of time, but overall it was well worth it–the gingerbread pieces held up and stuck together really well, and the kids loved decorating them so much!</description>

      <title>Sewing Harry Potter Hooded Towels!</title>

      <description>I happened upon this Harry Potter Hooded Towel tutorial and both got really excited (the kids love Harry Potter and so do I!) and felt kind of dumb (when they were tiny I had all sorts of ideas for cool hooded towels and I never realized a hooded towel is just a hand towel + a bath towel).
When I saw the tutorial I got some red towels for quidditch robes like in the tutorial and also some black ones.</description>

      <title>Halloween 2017: Sewing Ghost and Bunny Costumes</title>
      <link>/2017/10/halloween-2017-ghost-and-bunny/</link>

      <description>The kids are really excited about their Halloween costumes this year, and they’ve been in deep debate about what they should be. Logan is adamant that Halloween costumes should be scary, and he wants to be a ghost with glowing red eyes. Cole ignored Logan’s passionate arguments for scary costumes and waffled between pumpkin and bunny for several days, finally deciding to be a bunny.
The bunny was pretty straightforward; I picked up fuzzy bunny fabric at Joann’s and once again used the trusty Running With Scissors woodland animal pattern.</description>
