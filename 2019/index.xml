      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;d been really excited to try on my Glowforge was etching metal. Of course the Glowforge doesn&amp;rsquo;t etch metal directly, but there are a lot of posts on the Glowforge forums where people had spray painted metal and then etched it. I was really curious if it was easier to do than the laser transferred resists I&amp;rsquo;d been using. So I searched the forums for all the information I could find on methods people were using, and gave it a shot.</description>
