      <description>I’ve been doing a lot of knitting lately, and also a lot of reading Harry Potter to the boys. Logan especially loves it. I finally learned to knit a bottom up sweater, and got some beautiful chunky yarn at Spun, so knitting the boys Weasley sweaters felt like the perfect winter project. I had a lot of fun with it, and will definitely be doing more bottom up sweaters in the future!</description>

      <description>My grandmother taught me to knit when I was 8 or 9 years old, and I’ve been doing knitting projects on and off ever since. I switch back and forth between making things from patterns and designing them myself. I don’t really know what I’m doing; I make things up as I go and look up techniques in my trusty copy of Stitch ‘n Bitch if I get lost. Several years ago, I made my husband Doug a sweater, but he doesn’t wear it much because it needs to be hand-washed.</description>
