      <description>I really like the Jax patinas, but Vintaj offers some that are more like paint for metal and I really wanted to try them out. I had engraved a few extra brass business cards with pictures. One had the picture darkened with Jax black patina, and the other one hadn&amp;rsquo;t been finished at all, which resulted in the etched area naturally taking on a patina over time.
