      <description>We did Easter eggs for the first time this year. Logan requested that they be “scary”. So Doug and I shredded some crayons and we sprinkled them on the eggs while they were still hot after boiling. We all had a great time, and they look pretty different! Definitely cover the table and floor before trying this, though.

      <description>I got the book Cake Pops a while ago and I’ve been dying to try it out! There are a lot of recipes for spring, so I made some to take to the neighborhood Easter egg hunt. They were really easy to make and they taste great! I’m definitely going to try this again.
