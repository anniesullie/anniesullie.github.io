      <description>We have been running out of glasses lately and I’ve been thinking about decorating my own. I’ve seen some cool pictures of frosted glass online and wanted to try something like that myself. The first thing I tried was etching cream, which is pretty cheap and easy to find, but I ran into some big problems.
  You can see where the etching cream leaked at the top of the glass, and where it dripped around the back.</description>
