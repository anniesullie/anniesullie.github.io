      <description>When my team at work started doing a lot of projects in GitHub, I had trouble keeping up with all the notifications from the issue tracker in Gmail. Which mails were about bugs assigned to me? Bugs that had me in @ mentions? Bugs just from projects I was watching? Couldn’t the labels on the issues also be labels on the issue emails?
I’ve always been a huge fan of Google Apps Script for productivity.</description>
